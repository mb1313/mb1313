### About Me
I am an incoming Software Engineer at Mastercard in Vancouver, after my graduation from the University of British Columbia in May 2024. In my education, I'm majoring in Computer Science with a focus on algorithms, machine learning, and software development. 

I enjoy working on back-end applications, with primary experience in Java projects. I also have passions for data analysis / visualization, working with maps (the geographical kind), and algorithmic / machine learning projects.

In my free time, I enjoy running, skiing, and listening to music. My hottest take may be that breakfast is the best meal of the day.

### Work Experience
* Summer 2023: I returned for a summer internship at Mastercard in Vancouver with the Data Science Services team. I enjoyed working with an amazing team on projects in the following areas:

  * Both Monolithic and Microservice Architectures
  * REST APIs
  * Springboot Development
  * Automated Release Process
  * API Smoke Tests via Jenkins

* May-Dec 2022: I was fortunate to land a 7 month co-op at Mastercard in Vancouver on the Decision Management Platform. During this mostly remote experience, I gained skills in the following areas:

  * Maven Framework
  * Oracle SQL
  * Jenkins Automated Pipelines
  * CHEF Habitat
  * Selenium
  * General Agile Methodology Experience
 
* Summer 2020 and Summer 2021: I worked for the Space Science Institute, starting from scratch to build a database and a web-based query interface for data from the NASA Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter. I learned valuable skills in the following areas:

  * PHP
  * HTML / CSS
  * PostgreSQL
  * Python
  * Shell scripting

* Summer 2019: I worked for Code the Way, where myself and my high school peers worked to build a full-stack application for a local nonprofit. This experience gave me an intro to the following skills:

  * Full-stack Development in C#
  * Agile Methodologies
  * Meeting with Clients to Receive Feedback

### School Experience
In my education at the University of British Columbia, I grew from a first-year who (sort of) knew how to code into a graduate with robust knowledge of many different aspects of computer science, including:

* Machine Learning
* Computer Operating Systems and Memory Management
* Various Algorithms and their Implementations
* Data Structures
* Software Development
* Computer Networking / Internet Design
* Video Game Development (**check out our game [here](https://andrewting.itch.io/gravity-greens)!**)

I was lucky to attend such a high-quality institution where I got to learn from some truly remarkable instructors.
